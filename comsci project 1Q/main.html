        <p> This website aims to uphold goal 16 of SDG which is to promote just, peaceful, and inclusive societies. Lately, there have been many cases of injustice causing many problems. These problems do not just extend to just an individual but also our country, the Philippines </p>
        <p> Therefore, this website (again) aims to uphold goal 16 of SDG. With webpages that contain information regarding goal 16 and what we could do to reach this goal. Though it may seem impossible, with small and simple actions, we can make goal 16 possible! We can have peace, justice, and strong institutions.
